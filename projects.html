                    <p>I have experience in blockchain technology, as demonstrated by my work on a website facilitating
                        Ethereum testnet transactions, akin to Sepolia. This involved secure transfers between wallets
                        and
                        diverse platforms, including support for various platforms that allow testnets.</p>

                    <h3> Blockchain Powered Interoperable Healthcare Data Management</h3>
                    <p> I have experience in blockchain technology, showcased by my work on a website facilitating
                        secure file
                        management for patient healthcare data. Utilizing React.js, I developed a system that leverages
                        blockchain technology and IPFS through Pinata Cloud. This allows users to securely upload,
                        store, and
                        retrieve files, ensuring data integrity by storing hash codes in the database.</p>

                    <h3>Bank Customer Churn Prediction</h3>
                    <p>I have experience in Machine Learning technology, showcased by my work on a code facilitating
                        bank customer churn prediction. Utilizing Python, NumPy, and Pandas, I spearheaded the
                        development of a comprehensive Bank Customer Churn Prediction system. The objective of this
                        project was to create a robust predictive model that could accurately forecast whether a bank
                        customer was likely to churn.</p>

                    <h3> IPO Web Application - BLUESTOCK FINTECH</h3>
                    <p>I have Developed an IPO web application using React.js, allowing users to buy and sell shares
                        seamlessly. This project involved building an intuitive user interface to manage transactions,
                        providing real-time data for informed trading decisions and enhancing user engagement through
                        smooth, responsive interactions.</p>

                    <h3>QA Bot with RAG Model</h3>
                    <p>Implemented a QA bot using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to enhance information
                        retrieval accuracy. This project involved storing document embeddings in Pinecone for efficient
                        retrieval, enabling the bot to query and return highly relevant information based on user
                        queries. By refining document retrieval through optimized embeddings and targeted response
                        generation, this bot offers precise answers from the stored data, showcasing advanced natural
                        language processing skills.</p>
